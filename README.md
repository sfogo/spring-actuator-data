# Spring Boot Actuator Data
## Objective
This project was started from the basic actuator [sample](https://spring.io/guides/gs/actuator-service) and its java [classes](src/main/java/com/vnet/actuator) only deviate a litte from the base sample (just added some [initialization](src/main/java/com/vnet/actuator/Application.java)).

The objective is to explore the data that the [actuator endpoints](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-endpoints) return.
